# Agent with Tools Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to create and use agents with tools. These examples show how to extend language models with custom tools to perform specific tasks.

## Files

- `ex5_agent_with_tool.py`: Basic example of an agent using custom tools
- `ex5_agent_with_tool2.py`: Extended example with additional tool functionality
- `ex5_agent_with_tool3.py`: Further exploration of agent-tool interactions
- `ex5_agent_with_tool4.py`: Advanced agent-tool implementation

## Key Concepts

- Tool definition and implementation
- Agent configuration to use tools
- Tool execution and response handling
- Error handling in tool usage

## Usage

To run these examples:

```bash
python ex5_agent_with_tool.py
```

These examples build on the basic concepts and demonstrate how to give language models the ability to interact with external systems and data through custom tools.
