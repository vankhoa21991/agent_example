# LangGraph Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to use LangGraph, a framework for building stateful, structured agents with language models.

## Files

- `ex13_langraph_agent.py`: Basic LangGraph agent implementation with tool-calling capabilities
- `ex18_agentRAG_langgraph.py`: Integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangGraph
- `ex19_langgraph_supervisor.py`: Implementation of a supervisor agent using LangGraph
- `ex20_langgraph_supervisor.py`: Advanced supervisor pattern implementation
- `ex21_agentrag_python.py`: Python-specific RAG implementation using LangGraph

## Key Concepts

- Creating state graphs for agent workflows
- Defining nodes and edges in LangGraph
- Implementing conditional logic in agent workflows
- Building complex multi-agent systems
- Integrating tools with LangGraph agents
- Supervisor patterns for agent orchestration

## Usage

To run these examples:

```bash
python ex13_langraph_agent.py
```

LangGraph provides a powerful framework for building complex, stateful agent workflows that can handle sophisticated reasoning tasks and multi-step processes.
