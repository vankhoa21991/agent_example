# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables communication between language models and external tools/services.

## Files

- `ex14_agent_mcp_math.py`: Example of using MCP for mathematical operations
- `mcp_server.py`: Implementation of a basic MCP server
- `mcp_linkedin.py`: Example of using MCP to interact with LinkedIn data

## Key Concepts

- Setting up MCP servers
- Defining MCP tools and resources
- Connecting language models to MCP servers
- Building agents that leverage MCP capabilities
- Error handling in MCP communications

## Usage

To run these examples:

```bash
python ex14_agent_mcp_math.py
```

MCP provides a standardized way for language models to interact with external systems, enabling more powerful and flexible AI applications.
