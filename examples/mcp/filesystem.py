"""üìÅ MCP Filesystem Agent - Your Personal File Explorer!

This example shows how to create a filesystem agent that uses MCP to explore,
analyze, and provide insights about files and directories. The agent leverages the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with the filesystem, allowing it to answer questions
about file contents, directory structures, and more.

Example prompts to try:
- "What files are in the current directory?"
- "Show me the content of README.md"
- "What is the license for this project?"
- "Find all Python files in the project"
- "Summarize the main functionality of the codebase"

Run: `pip install agno mcp openai` to install the dependencies
