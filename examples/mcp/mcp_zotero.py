"""📁 Groq + MCP = Lightning Fast Agents

This example demonstrates how to create a high-performance filesystem agent by combining
Groq's fast LLM inference with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This combination delivers
exceptional speed while maintaining powerful filesystem exploration capabilities.

Example prompts to try:
- "What files are in the current directory?"
- "Show me the content of README.md"
- "What is the license for this project?"
- "Find all Python files in the project"
- "Analyze the performance benefits of using Groq with MCP"

Run: `pip install agno mcp openai` to install the dependencies
