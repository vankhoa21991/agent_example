# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating various implementations of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that enhances language models with external knowledge retrieval.

## Subfolders

- **mongodb**: Examples using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for RAG implementations
- **qdrant**: Examples using Qdrant vector database for RAG implementations
- **advanced**: Advanced RAG techniques including map-reduce, parent-child architectures, and more

## Key Concepts

- Vector databases for semantic search
- Document chunking and embedding
- Query processing and retrieval
- Context augmentation
- Response generation
- Advanced RAG architectures

## Overview

RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems with generative language models. By retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using it to augment the context provided to a language model, RAG systems can generate more accurate, factual, and contextually relevant responses.

These examples demonstrate different approaches to implementing RAG systems using various vector databases and architectures.
