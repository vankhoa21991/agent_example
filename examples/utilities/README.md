# Utilities

This folder contains utility scripts and helper functions that support the examples in other folders.

## Files

- `utils.py`: General utility functions used across multiple examples
- `search_yt.py`: Utilities for searching and processing YouTube content
- `bot.py`: Bot implementation utilities
- `mongodb_atlas.py`: Utilities for working with MongoDB Atlas

## Purpose

These utility files provide common functionality that is used across multiple examples, including:

- Data processing and transformation
- API integrations
- Database connections and operations
- File handling
- Text processing
- Search functionality
- Configuration management

## Usage

These utilities are typically imported by other example scripts rather than being run directly. For example:

```python
from utils import process_text, format_response

# Use the utility functions in your code
processed_text = process_text(input_text)
formatted_response = format_response(result)
```

By centralizing common functionality in these utility files, the example code remains cleaner and more focused on demonstrating specific concepts.
