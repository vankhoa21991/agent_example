## Summary
**Oumi: A Comprehensive Platform for Foundation Models**
======================================================

**Overview**
-----------

Oumi is a fully open-source platform designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of foundation models, from data preparation and training to evaluation and deployment. It provides a consistent API, production-grade reliability, and flexibility for research, making it an ideal solution for developers, researchers, and organizations working with large-scale language models.

**Key Features**
---------------

### Model Training and Fine-tuning

* Train and fine-tune models with 10M to 405B parameters using state-of-the-art techniques (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO, and more)
* Work with both text and multimodal models (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, Phi, and others)

### Data Preparation and Curation

* Synthesize and curate training data with LLM judges
* Filter and curate training data using Oumi's data preparation tools

### Model Evaluation and Deployment

* Evaluate models comprehensively across standard benchmarks
* Deploy models efficiently with popular inference engines (vLLM, SGLang)
* Run models on various platforms, including laptops, clusters, clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda, and more)

### Integration and Collaboration

* Integrate with both open models and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Together, Parasail, and more)
* Collaborate with others using Oumi's job management and remote training features

**Guides and Resources**
-------------------------

* **Getting Started**: A quick tour of core features, including training, evaluation, inference, and job management
* **Model Finetuning Guide**: An end-to-end guide to LoRA tuning with data prep, training, and evaluation
* **Model Distillation**: A guide to distilling large models into smaller, efficient ones
